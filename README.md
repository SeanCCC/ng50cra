This repository provides an interactive LINE web experience for the Golden Horse 60 event.

Golden Horse 60 - Tribute to Cinema

ðŸŽ¬ Interactive Audio Story Experience on Golden Horseâ€™s Official LINE Account is now live!

Time, characters, and eventsâ€”these are the three key elements that shape a film.
In a specific era and setting, a single line of dialogue or a simple action can trigger an entire story.

To celebrate Golden Horse 60, 22 filmmakers have recorded exclusive stories from their works.
Participants will be guided to select three story clips, creating a unique personalized script.
With 280 possible combinations, which one will you get?

Beyond the script, youâ€™ll also receive a nominee character cardâ€”find out which award youâ€™ve been nominated for! ðŸŽ­âœ¨
